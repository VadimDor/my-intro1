- `SOME_ENV_VAR`: set this environment variable in your shell config to load the correct version of tool x.

# Install

[Install asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html), then:

Plugin:


```sh
asdf plugin add asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC> # install the asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC> plugin
# or
asdf plugin add <TOOL REPO>.git

asdf asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC> install-deps  # install system-specific dependencies for downloading & building <YOUR TOOL ULC>
```

### To install <YOUR TOOL ULC>:

When available for the version and platform, the plugin will install pre-compiled binaries of <YOUR TOOL ULC>. If no binaries are available the plugin will build <YOUR TOOL ULC> from source.

```sh
# latest stable version of <YOUR TOOL ULC>
asdf install asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC> latest
# or latest stable minor/patch release of <YOUR TOOL ULC> 1.x.x
asdf install asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC> latest:1
# or latest stable patch release of <YOUR TOOL ULC> 1.6.x
asdf install asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC> latest:1.6
# or specific patch release
asdf install asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC> 1.6.8
```

### To install a nightly build of <YOUR TOOL ULC>:

```sh
# nightly unstable build of devel branch
asdf install asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC> ref:devel
# or nightly unstable build of version-1-6 branch, i.e. the latest 1.6.x release + any recent backports from devel
asdf install asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC> ref:version-1-6
# or nightly unstable build of version-1-4 branch, i.e. the latest 1.4.x release + any recent backports from devel
asdf install asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC> ref:version-1-4
# or nightly unstable build of version-1-2 branch, i.e. the 1.2.x release + any recent backports from devel
asdf install asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC> ref:version-1-2
# or nightly unstable build of version-1-0 branch, i.e. the 1.0.x release + any recent backports from devel
asdf install asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC> ref:version-1-0
```

### To build a specific git commit or branch of <YOUR TOOL ULC>:

```sh
# build using latest commit from the devel branch
asdf install asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC> ref:HEAD
# build using the specific commit 7d15fdd
asdf install asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC> ref:7d15fdd
# build using the tagged release v1.6.8
asdf install asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC> ref:v1.6.8
```


asdf-<YOUR TOOL>:

```shell
# Show all installable versions
asdf list-all asdf-<YOUR TOOL>

# Install specific version
asdf install asdf-<YOUR TOOL> latest

# Set a version globally (on your ~/.tool-versions file)
asdf global asdf-<YOUR TOOL> latest

# Now asdf-<YOUR TOOL> commands are available
<TOOL CHECK>
```

install & manage versions.


# asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC>

asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC> allows you to quickly install any version of [<YOUR TOOL ULC>](https://asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC>-lang.org).

asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC> is intended for end-users and continuous integration. Whether macOS or Linux, x86 or ARM - all you'll need to install <YOUR TOOL ULC> is bash.



### To set the default version of <YOUR TOOL ULC> for your user:

```sh
asdf global asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC> latest:1.6
```

This creates a `.tool-versions` file in your home directory specifying the <YOUR TOOL ULC> version.

### To set the version of <YOUR TOOL ULC> for a project directory:

```sh
cd my-project
asdf local asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC> latest:1.6
```

This creates a `.tool-versions` file in the current directory specifying the <YOUR TOOL ULC> version. For additional plugin usage see the [asdf documentation](https://asdf-vm.com/#/core-manage-asdf).

## asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC> packages

asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC> packages are installed in `~/.asdf/installs/asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC>/<asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC>-version>/asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC>/pkgs`, unless a `asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC>deps` directory exists in the directory where `asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC> install` is run from.

See the [asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC> documentation](https://github.com/asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC>-lang/asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC>#asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC>s-folder-structure-and-packages) for more information about asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC>deps.

## Continuous Integration

### A simple example using GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: Build
on:
  push:
    paths-ignore:
      - README.md

env:
  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

jobs:
  build:
    name: Test
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    matrix:
      include:
        # Test against stable <YOUR TOOL ULC> builds on linux
        - os: ubuntu-latest
          asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC>-version: latest:1.6
        - os: ubuntu-latest
          asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC>-version: latest:1.4

        # Test against unstable nightly <YOUR TOOL ULC> builds on macos (faster than building from source)
        - os: macos-latest
          asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC>-version: ref:version-1-6
        - os: macos-latest
          asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC>-version: ref:version-1-4
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install <YOUR TOOL ULC>
        uses: asdf-vm/actions/install@v1
        with:
          tool_versions: |
            asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC> ${{ matrix.asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC>-version }}
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          asdf local asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC> ${{ matrix.asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC>-version }}
          asdf-<YOUR TOOL LC> develop -y
